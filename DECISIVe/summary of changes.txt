Summary of changes:

We thank the reviewers for their extensive and helpful comments. In response to their suggestions, we made the following changes:

1) We included an explicit “data manipulation” subsection detailing what sort of attacks might be possible by the type of control over the data that a visualization designer is likely to have.

2) Expanded the conclusion to include references to prior and existing work on classifying the persuasive content of visualizations, as well as automated techniques for analyzing and correcting for potentially misleading design elements.

3) Clarified the distinction between malicious and incompetent visualization design, making it clear that our decision to focus on the former is due to our belief that it is the stronger and more difficult of the two sorts of failures.

4) General edits for clarity and precision.

We once again thank the reviewers for their time and expertise, and look forward to presenting this work at DECISIVE this year.
