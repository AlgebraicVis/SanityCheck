    <h3>Perception of Data Quality Issues in Viusualizations</h3>
    <p>You are invited by Michael Correll of the Tableau Research team to participate in a research study about how users make judgements about information in different kinds of charts. You have been asked to participate because we need to know what design factors determine how easy it is to detect data quality issues, given different amounts of data and different chart types.</p>
    <p>This study will include participants over 18 years of age who feel comfortable using an online interface to read graphs and answer questions about data.</p>
    <h4><b>What Will My Participation Involve?</b></h4>
    <p>If you decide to participate in this research, you will be asked to answer questions about fictional data, using a number of charts or graphs to assist you in making decisions. You will be presented with a set of charts, and asked to select the chart that meets certain criteria. After the main task, we will collect basic demographic information. We expect this study to take 30 minutes.</p>
    <h4><b>Are There Any Risks To Me?</b></h4>
    <p>We don't anticipate any risks from participation in this study greater than normal activity.</p>
    <h4><b>Are There Any Benefits To Me?</b></h4>
    <p>There are no direct benefits to you other than compensation.</p>
    <h4><b>Will I Be Compensated For My Participation?</b></h4>
    <p>You will receive $4.00 for participating in this study. If you do withdraw prior to the end of the study, you will receive no compensation.</p>
    <h4><b>Whom Should I Contact If I Have Questions?</b></h4>
    <p>You may ask any questions about the research at any time. If you have questions about the research after your participation, you should contact the lead researcher, <a href="mailto:mcorrell@tableau.com">Dr. Michael Correll</a> (mcorrell _at_ tableau.com). Your participation is completely voluntary. If you begin participation and change your mind you may end your participation at any time without penalty.</p>
    <h4><b>Privacy Statement</b></h4>
      <p>Your responses to this experiment will be used only by the lead researcher to help us answer questions about chart design. Once collected, your information will be anonymized, and stored on a secure server.</p>
      <p>While there will probably be publications as a result of this study, your name or participant ID will not be used. Only group characteristics will be published.</p>
