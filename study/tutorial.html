  <h2>Main Task</h2>
  <p>In this study, you will be looking for <b>flaws</b> in charts of data. You will be shown a grid of charts that each have sample data in them. Most of the charts are random data, but one of these will have a flaw. Your task is to select the chart that has the flaw. In some cases, this flaw will be difficult to see, or the random noisy data in the other charts will make many of the other charts look flawed. In those cases, give your best guess.</p>

  <h2>Chart Types</h2>
  <div class="fig">
    <div class="figImg"><img src="img/scatter.png" /></div>
    <div class="figImg"><img src="img/histogram.png" /></div>
    <div class="figImg"><img src="img/density.png" /></div>
    <div class="figCaption">The same sample data, represented as a scatterplot, histogram, and density plot.</div>
  </div>
  <p>You will see three different chart types. </p>

  <h3>Scatterplots</h3>
  <p>Scatterplots have a small circle for every single data point.</p>

  <h3>Histograms</h3>
  <p>Histograms are charts with several bars in them. The more data that there is in a given region, the taller that region's bar is.</p>

  <h3>Density plots</h3>
  <p>Density plots are like histograms, but create smooth shapes that are taller where there is more data.</p>

  <h2>Flaw Types</h2>
  <p>You will see one of three types of flaws in each question. You will be told what kind of flaw to look for. </p>

  <h3>Outliers</h3>
  <p>For data with outliers, there will be a large amount of data points that are much lower, or much higher, than most of the rest of the data.</p>
  <div class="fig">
    <div class="figImg"><img src="img/scatter.png" /></div>
    <div class="figImg"><img src="img/histogram.png" /></div>
    <div class="figImg"><img src="img/density.png" /></div>
    <div class="figCaption">The original data on the left, and the data with outliers on the right.</div>
  </div>

  <h3>Spikes</h3>
  <p>For data with spikes, there will be a lot of data points with the exact same value.</p>
  <div class="fig">
    <div class="figImg"><img src="img/scatter.png" /></div>
    <div class="figImg"><img src="img/histogram.png" /></div>
    <div class="figImg"><img src="img/density.png" /></div>
    <div class="figCaption">The original data on the left, and the data with a spike on the right.</div>
  </div>

  <h3>Gaps</h3>
  <p>For data with gaps, there will be a region where there are no visible data points.</p>
  <div class="fig">
    <div class="figImg"><img src="img/scatter.png" /></div>
    <div class="figImg"><img src="img/histogram.png" /></div>
    <div class="figImg"><img src="img/density.png" /></div>
    <div class="figCaption">The original data on the left, and the data with a gap on the right.</div>
  </div>
